Trail map overlay for Lake Padden Park in Bellingham, Washington, USA

This is a small iOS app that overlays an image of the City of Bellingham's trail map for Lake Padden park onto a standard MKMapView. 

There is a slider that lets you adjust the transparency of the trail map versus the satellite map view, and a control that lets you locate yourself on the map and orient the map relative to the device's orientation. 

The map alignment was done manually/experimentally, so it's probably not anywhere close to perfect. Pull requests gladly accepted. 

**NOTE:** Please don't use this in conditions where getting lost would be dangerous, rather than merely inconvenient.
